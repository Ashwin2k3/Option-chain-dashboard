When deploying an app to Streamlit or other cloud services and encountering the `403 Forbidden` error while fetching data from NSE, it's typically due to additional anti-scraping measures by NSE. Unfortunately, Streamlit shares common IP ranges with other cloud services, which may trigger NSE's anti-bot protections.

Here are some additional strategies you can try:

### 1. **Use a Rotating Proxy Service**:
NSE likely blocks certain IP ranges, especially from known cloud providers. You can use a rotating proxy service that assigns a new IP address with each request. This helps mimic different users and prevents NSE from blocking your requests.

You can look into services like:
- **Bright Data** (formerly Luminati)
- **ScraperAPI**
- **ProxyMesh**
- **GeoSurf**

These services provide APIs to manage proxies, and you can rotate them for each request.

#### Example using a proxy:
```python
import requests

proxies = {
    'http': 'http://your_proxy_here',
    'https': 'http://your_proxy_here'
}

def fetch_nse_data():
    url = 'https://www.nseindia.com/api/option-chain-indices?symbol=NIFTY'
    headers = {
        'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36',
        'Accept-Language': 'en-US,en;q=0.9',
        'Accept-Encoding': 'gzip, deflate, br',
        'Connection': 'keep-alive',
        'Referer': 'https://www.nseindia.com/option-chain'
    }

    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, proxies=proxies)

    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        print(f"Failed to fetch data from NSE: {response.status_code}")
        return None
```

### 2. **Add Randomized Headers and Delays**:
Add random delays and rotate user agents and headers with each request to make your requests look more human-like.

#### Example:
```python
import requests
import random
import time

USER_AGENTS = [
    'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36',
    'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/14.0.3 Safari/605.1.15',
    # Add more user agents as needed
]

def fetch_nse_data():
    url = 'https://www.nseindia.com/api/option-chain-indices?symbol=NIFTY'
    headers = {
        'User-Agent': random.choice(USER_AGENTS),
        'Accept-Language': 'en-US,en;q=0.9',
        'Accept-Encoding': 'gzip, deflate, br',
        'Connection': 'keep-alive',
        'Referer': 'https://www.nseindia.com/option-chain'
    }

    time.sleep(random.uniform(1, 3))  # Random delay between requests
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        print(f"Failed to fetch data from NSE: {response.status_code}")
        return None
```

### 3. **Scrape Using Browser Automation (Selenium)**:
If all else fails, you could try to scrape NSE data using a headless browser with **Selenium**. NSE’s website would perceive the request as coming from an actual browser.

You could then deploy the Selenium script to a service like **Heroku** or **AWS Lambda** that supports running headless browsers.

#### Example:
```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options

def fetch_nse_data_selenium():
    chrome_options = Options()
    chrome_options.add_argument("--headless")  # Run Chrome in headless mode
    chrome_options.add_argument("--no-sandbox")
    chrome_options.add_argument("--disable-dev-shm-usage")

    driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=chrome_options)
    driver.get("https://www.nseindia.com/option-chain")

    # Now you can interact with the page and fetch data
    page_source = driver.page_source
    driver.quit()
    return page_source  # You can parse this using BeautifulSoup
```

### 4. **Use an External API for NSE Data**:
Instead of scraping NSE directly, you can use third-party services that offer data for NSE’s option chain. Some services provide APIs, such as:
- **StockEdge** (paid)
- **Alpha Vantage**
- **Upstox API**

These services offer legal and reliable ways to get stock and options data without worrying about being blocked.

### 5. **Use an India-based Server**:
Deploying your Streamlit app to a server located in India might reduce the chances of being blocked by NSE. Services like **AWS** or **Azure** allow you to select a specific region (e.g., Mumbai) for deploying your app.

### Summary of Next Steps:
- **Try using proxies** to avoid IP blocks.
- **Add random delays and rotate user agents** to reduce the risk of getting blocked.
- **Switch to Selenium** for browser automation, which simulates real users.
- **Consider third-party APIs** for stock market data if NSE blocks are persistent.
- **Use a server located in India** if NSE is region-specific in blocking requests.

These strategies should improve your chances of successful deployment without hitting NSE's restrictions.
